# aws-lambda-test-utils

Testing your AWS Lambda Functions does not need to be difficult or complex.

If you are *new* to Amazon WebServices Lambda
(*or need a refresher*),
please checkout our our  
***Beginners Guide to AWS Lambda***:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-aws-lambda

##Â Why?

Testing your code is *essential* everywhere you need *reliability*.


AWS Lambda has a **Testing _Console_** which is a *web-based*
way of invoking your function(s) with a given input and
monitoring the result. But this quite slow and *cannot be automated* (*yet*).

## What?

The simplest *possilbe* way we could think of for Testing
our AWS Lambda functions.

## *How*? (*Usage*)

### *install* `aws-lambda-test-utils` from NPM

```sh
npm install aws-lambda-test-utils --save-dev
```

### Use in your Tests
